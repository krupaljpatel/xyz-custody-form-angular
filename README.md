# XYZ Custody Account Opening Form - Angular Application

A dynamic Angular form application that replicates the XYZ Custody Account Opening Form Excel worksheet with comprehensive conditional field logic and validation.

## Overview

This project converts a complex Excel-based financial form into a modern web application, preserving all conditional logic, validation rules, and user experience from the original Excel format.

## Features

### ðŸ“‹ Form Structure
- **4 Main Tabs**: AOF Page 1, AOF Page 2, Additional SWIFTs, User Guide
- **15 Numbered Sections**: From General Account Information to Fund Order & Custody
- **Dynamic Field Types**: Text inputs, dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, multiselect, tables

### ðŸ”„ Conditional Logic
- **Service-Based Conditionals**: Fields show/hide based on selected services (FX, Cash, Physical)
- **Address Logic**: Billing address fields conditional on "Same as Primary" selection
- **Mailing Format Dependencies**: SWIFT/Infuse options based on format selection
- **Cross-Page Validation**: Dependencies between different form sections

### âœ… Validation & UX
- **Field-Level Validation**: Pattern matching, required fields, character limits
- **Cross-Field Rules**: Complex business logic validation
- **Real-time Feedback**: Dynamic error messages and help text
- **Excel-Like Experience**: Maintains familiar workflow and visual design

## Technical Implementation

### Metadata-Driven Architecture
- **form-metadata.json**: Complete form structure with conditional logic
- **Dynamic Field Rendering**: Components generated from metadata
- **Conditional Engine**: Reactive form logic based on field dependencies

### Key Conditional Patterns
```json
{
  "conditional": {
    "field": "triggerFieldName",
    "operator": "equals|in|not_equals", 
    "value": "expectedValue|[array]",
    "showWhen": true|false
  }
}
```

## Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ form-metadata.json          # Complete form configuration

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ XYZ Custody Account Opening Form - Client.xlsx
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                        # Angular application source

â””â”€â”€ .gitignore                 # Git exclusions
```

## Conditional Logic Examples

- **XYZ Account Number**: Only shows when "Do you have XYZ Account Number reserved?" = "Yes"

- **Billing Address**: Street/City/Country fields hidden when "Same as Primary" checked
- **Mailing Options**: SWIFT options show for SWIFT/Both, Infuse ID for Infuse/Both
